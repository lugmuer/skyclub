** Highlights
     Tables that will be rebuilt
       [dbo].[User]
     Clustered indexes that will be dropped

     Clustered indexes that will be created

     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[User].[Email] on table [dbo].[User] must be added, but the column has no default value and does not
         allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must either: add
         a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a
         deployment option.
       The type for column Name in table [dbo].[User] is currently  NCHAR (10) NULL but is being changed to  VARCHAR (MAX) NOT
         NULL. Data loss could occur.
